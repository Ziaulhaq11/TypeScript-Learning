npm install -g typescript

tsc app.ts

TypeScript only works on build time not on Run Time. So you can catch errors while development not in Run Time. We can do this but that we can see later.

tsc app.ts --watch / -w -- it will watch only single file

tsc --init  -- It will create tsconfig.json file
tsc -- just for once
tsc -w
